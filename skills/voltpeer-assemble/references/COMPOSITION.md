# Reproducible multi-panel assembly

This route accepts author-supplied raster panels (PNG/JPEG/TIFF) and one-page PDF/SVG panels. It outputs a physical-size PDF, a 300 dpi or higher PNG preview, per-panel crops, an alignment overlay, and a JSON audit. PDF/SVG sources stay vector where the source permits it. Raster images are never made vector by wrapping them in PDF.

## Run it

Install the skill's Python dependencies in an isolated project environment (Python ≥3.10):

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Inspect a folder first, then compose with a reviewed manifest:

```bash
python scripts/compose_figure.py inventory \
  --input path/to/figure_sources --output path/to/inspection
python scripts/compose_figure.py compose \
  --manifest path/to/figure_manifest.json --out path/to/Fig3 --strict
```

`--strict` blocks output when the tool detects low effective raster DPI, excessive white margins, underfilled slots, unclear rights, missing alignment intent, or measured plot-area misalignment. Without it, the tool produces an explicit review draft and reports each warning. Geometry checks do not certify scientific interpretation, copyright permission, font embedding or the target journal's current technical requirements.

For a self-contained synthetic check:

```bash
python examples/demo_assemble.py outputs/assemble-demo
```

The example contains no research observations.

### Editable whole-figure SVG

For panels exported from the same plotting run as both PDF and SVG, add `editable_svg_path` beside the PDF `path` in each panel record. Check that the two files have the same content and aspect ratio. Then use:

```bash
python scripts/compose_figure.py compose \
  --manifest path/to/figure_manifest.json --out path/to/Fig3 --strict --svg
```

The exporter uses the measured PDF placement for each paired native SVG, prefixes internal IDs and preserves editable text and paths. It blocks external links, executable SVG, missing sidecars, cropping and incompatible aspect ratios. SVG sidecars are assertions by the author, so a geometric check does not prove their content matches the PDF. Embedded raster elements remain raster; the operando XRD teaching example contains an embedded raster matrix. This option applies to `compose`; `deliver` retains its existing PDF/PNG contract. Direct SVG input still requires CairoSVG and native Cairo. Paired PDF input with SVG export does not require Cairo.

Three complete analytic teaching examples are in `examples/paper_figures/` at the repository root. Their downloaded source package includes this composer. They show cycling, solvation methods and an illustrative FCC operando map, with declared inputs, panel roles and replay commands. They are not measured battery results or universal journal templates. Empty layout resources remain a separate panel-manifest route.

`demo_assemble.py --help` only displays arguments. Use `--output NEW_FOLDER --without-svg` for a PDF/PNG-only demonstration when native Cairo is unavailable. SVG input specifically requires both the CairoSVG Python package and working native Cairo libraries; a successful package install does not prove SVG input is usable. Export a supplied SVG to vector PDF in its source editor when that optional capability is unavailable. Do not rename a raster file to PDF or claim it became editable.

For ordinary handoff after inspection, use `compose_figure.py deliver --manifest MANIFEST --out WORKING_FOLDER [--strict]`. Final PDF/PNG appear in `results/`, a root `index.html` opens them, and detailed QA, source mappings and recovery are retained under `.voltpeer/`. Existing outputs receive new version names. The older `compose` command still exports developer-facing diagnostics; it also preserves earlier versions. PNG DPI is a preview choice and does not change embedded raster source resolution. Named journal requirements still need exact article/content-class confirmation. Public sharing uses `scripts/share_bundle.py` only after author-confirmed rights and license; do not publish the private Working folder.

## Manifest contract

Paths are relative to the manifest. The author keeps the unaltered source files beside it or in a linked project folder. Each `source_id` identifies the original paper, dataset, experimental file or self-created diagram. Use `rights_status` of `original`, `licensed`, `permission_granted`, `pending`, or `unknown`. Licensed reuse also needs `license` and `credit`; granted permission needs `permission_record`. `pending` and `unknown` remain review warnings and block a strict final bundle.

Rows have explicit heights in millimetres. Column weights divide the available width after outer margins and gutters. `rowspan` and `colspan` may make a hero or a wide comparison panel. Every grid cell must be occupied exactly once unless `allow_empty_cells: true` and `empty_cell_reason` are supplied. The rendered figure height follows the row heights plus vertical gutters and margins. Panels use `contain`: no stretching, hidden automatic trim or implicit crop. Panel letters are placed in a consistent strip outside the artwork; set global `draw_labels: false` only when the sources already carry a coherent label system.

### Pack the content, not only the page frames

Set `output_purpose` to `manuscript` for a paper figure or `showcase` for a website demonstration. This documents the audience; neither option changes the data. `layout_mode: editorial_pack` adds visible-content checks. For panels that each occupy a single row, `row_heights_mm: "auto"` sizes each row from its widest source aspect ratio at its allocated column width. Row-spanning panels still require explicit heights. The final PDF never stretches an image.

For a measured source use `content_box_fraction: [left, top, right, bottom]` to identify the actual nonblank content and `plot_box_fraction` separately for the quantitative axes. The report records `content_bbox_mm`, `slot_fill_ratio`, `interpanel_gaps` in millimetres, `outer_whitespace_ratio`, and whether the content box is declared or a white-edge estimate. In editorial mode, content filling less than 78% of its slot or a related visible gap above 4 mm triggers a review warning unless a specific `whitespace_reason` explains the choice. These are review thresholds, not universal journal requirements. Raster white pixels are never silently cropped; a white region may contain meaningful axes, a scale bar or deliberately blank image area.

Set `compound_panel: true` when a supplied file itself contains several subplots. A compound smaller than 70 mm wide is flagged. Give it a larger slot or, when editable data/source exists, split and rerender each subplot at its final slot size. Do not enlarge a raster or trim a published figure just to satisfy a fill ratio. For manuscript panels, prefer 2–3 mm outer margins/gutters when the target journal allows; a larger showcase margin can be intentional. The author still inspects every panel at final physical size. **A geometry pass never proves that the layout reads well.**

The composer does not create figure titles or subtitles. Keep that behavior when making a manifest or manually editing the PDF: a panel letter is enough when its axes, direct labels and the figure caption explain the content. Do not fill an apparently empty label band with headings. A source panel's existing title can be removed only from an editable source and only after checking that it does not carry the condition or sample identity; record the change in the panel ledger.

### Align the actual plot areas

Equal frames do not guarantee equal chart axes. Declare `alignment_intent` for **every** panel in a multi-panel figure. Use `compare` for panels whose plotted areas should align and `independent` only with a concrete `alignment_reason` (for example, a schematic beside a plot). For every comparable panel, add the same `alignment_group` and a **measured** `plot_box_fraction: [left, top, right, bottom]`. These fractions describe the actual plotted axes rectangle inside the placed source after any explicit crop. Do not guess them from the outer image size.

At final physical size, the coordinate-ruler audit checks same-row plot-area top, bottom and height; same-column left, right and width. The default tolerance is 1.5 pt (about 0.53 mm). The JSON records each edge and its measured difference. The diagnostic overlay marks slots red, placed art blue, approximate visible content cyan, actual declared plot boxes green, and millimetre ticks along the top and left. Cyan is a white-background estimate, **not** a verified scientific plot boundary. If a comparable source has no measurable plot box, `--strict` blocks; regenerate or measure the real axes rectangle. If there are only scientifically independent panels, the report says visual review is still required; it does not claim their content edges were proved equal.

For a Matplotlib source, measure `ax.get_position()` **after** the final draw/layout pass or use the selected plotting backend's final axes bounds. For an imported PDF/SVG or image, inspect the final rendered panel with a ruler and record the true axes edges. Do not infer boundaries from legends or outer white margins. Move axes or rerender sources on a shared canvas instead of stretching or blindly cropping data. Re-run the ruler after any change to text, legend, aspect ratio, export or panel slot. A deliberate unequal width needs a panel-specific explanation; never increase the global tolerance to hide it.

### Crop only with a scientific reason

Raster panels may use `crop_px: [left, top, right, bottom]` in source pixels plus `crop_reason`. PDF/SVG may use `crop_box_fraction: [left, top, right, bottom]` relative to the original page box plus `crop_reason`; their page crop keeps vector content. The tool does not choose these values automatically. Compare before/after at full resolution and retain axes, scale bars, labels, uncertainty and relevant image regions. For micrographs, record calibration and any brightness/contrast/LUT changes separately; this assembler makes no tone adjustment.

If a source has more than one PDF page, set `page_number` explicitly. Multi-frame TIFFs must be exported to a stated frame first. An SVG with external resources is rejected; embed or supply those resources in a trusted source file before composing.

## Release check

Read the inventory, composite preview, alignment overlay and **each panel crop**. Check real journal width, not just a zoomed canvas. Confirm panel order follows the claim; consistent fonts, strokes, palette and legend treatment; no missing or duplicated letters; no clipped axes or scale bars; adequate effective DPI; comparable testing boundaries; complete captions and permissions. Inspect the PDF's text and vector/raster structure. When panels are native plots, rerender them at common physical slot sizes instead of repeatedly scaling export files to hide layout defects.

For a mixed-source figure, make a brief panel harmonization table before composing: each panel's physical slot width, plotted-area rectangle, measured final-size glyph size when vector text is available, line weight, legend placement, panel-letter status, original palette, raster DPI, and unresolved rights/conditions. Treat text embedded in a raster image as an estimate, not a measured font size. If one panel is too small or uses a conflicting chart palette, regenerate it from editable source or data with the manuscript's selected style. Never change the color mapping of microscopy or spectral intensity merely to match another panel.

The `font_audit` section of the QA JSON measures extractable vector text in the **final composed PDF** by panel. It reports the smallest and median detected sizes and flags sizes below 6 pt for manual review; 6 pt is a screening threshold, not a journal rule. Raster and outlined lettering are marked unmeasurable. A clean scan does not prove that every label is readable: inspect the exported PDF at the physical submission width and compare its caption and axis labels with the target journal's current requirements.

Some PDF text scanners report oversized text boxes when an SVG-to-PDF export encodes glyph size through a transform. Treat a scanner warning as a lead to investigate: inspect the exact rendered glyphs at final size, compare the source SVG/PDF, and keep the scan result and resolution note. Never dismiss a visible collision because the manifest geometry passes.

## 中文速用

先用 `inventory` 对作者提供的图片、PDF、SVG 生成素材清单与联系页，逐张看内容、空白边、轴标签、比例尺和权限。再按整图论断为各面板安排证据职责，使用毫米单位的 JSON 网格写清宽度、行高、栏宽、间距和面板顺序。`compose` 会输出 PDF、PNG、各面板检查图、带毫米刻度的对齐叠加图及 QA JSON。每张面板都要声明 `alignment_intent`：要互相比坐标轴的用 `compare`，并填写同一 `alignment_group` 和真实量出的 `plot_box_fraction`；示意图等不比较坐标轴的用 `independent`，写明原因。严格模式不会把漏填的面板当作“已对齐”。图片不拉伸；裁剪必须显式记录原因。最终仍需在投稿尺寸逐张检查，并核对电池测试条件、引用和图片复用许可。

### Explicit alignment guides (native Figure deliveries 1.0.1)

A manifest may include `alignment_guides`, for example `[{"id":"outer-right","edge":"right","panels":["a","b","d"]}]`. Each guide measures a named edge of the actual `plot_box_fraction` after physical placement, even across different column spans. Accepted edges: left, right, top, bottom, width, height. Guides need two or more unique existing panel labels and measured plot rectangles. Missing/invalid declarations or a difference over 1.5 pt block strict export. A colourbar or twin-axis label stays in a reserved outer margin; equal grid cells are not sufficient evidence of axis alignment. Existing manifests without guides retain the original group checks.
